# EasyLang - Programming Language Interpreter

EasyLang is a simple programming language interpreter built with TypeScript and React. It provides an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment for users to write, execute, and debug EasyLang code.

## Why I Made It

I created EasyLang because I believe that everyone should have the opportunity to learn the basics of programming. EasyLang is designed with simplicity in mind, featuring an easy-to-understand syntax that makes it accessible to beginners. It empowers users to start coding without the steep learning curve of more complex languages.

## Features

- Interactive REPL for EasyLang code.
- Syntax highlighting using Prism.js.
- Modular and extensible architecture for lexer, parser, and interpreter.
- Built with modern web technologies like React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.
